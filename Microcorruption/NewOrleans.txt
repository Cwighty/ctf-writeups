The first thing I did was look through the section/function names. The first one to catch my eye was "<create_password>".
It seemed to be loading certain hex values at specific distances from register 15...

4482:  ff40 2600 0000 mov.b	#0x26, 0x0(r15)
4488:  ff40 4900 0100 mov.b	#0x49, 0x1(r15)
448e:  ff40 7200 0200 mov.b	#0x72, 0x2(r15)
4494:  ff40 5c00 0300 mov.b	#0x5c, 0x3(r15)
449a:  ff40 4e00 0400 mov.b	#0x4e, 0x4(r15)
44a0:  ff40 6700 0500 mov.b	#0x67, 0x5(r15)
44a6:  ff40 5000 0600 mov.b	#0x50, 0x6(r15)
44ac:  cf43 0700      mov.b	#0x0, 0x7(r15)

I especially noticed that the last one was loading in a null terminating char (0x0) so this immediately looked like
it could be loading in each char of the password. I copied each value into a hex to ascii website and got out "&Ir\NgP".
I restarted the debugger, plugged that in as the password and it unlocked the lock.
